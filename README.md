# strategic-pricing
This is a depository for samples of my class project in Econ 487: Data Science and Strategic Pricing. 

The source data ("oj.csv") is store-level sales data from Dominick's stores in the Chicago area from the 1990s. Details: https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/dominicks.

Besides the Rmd code files, HTML output files are also included for ease of viewing.

**"strategic-pricing" file**
Includes plots of the data, models and discussions of price and other variables' effect on demand/sales, intertemporal substitution, and implications for price markups. Also includes obtaining price elasticities with trees.

**"Double ML" file**
I used the Double Machine Learning technique (with RandomForest) to estimate price elasticities of three brands of orange juice.
